        # 
        # 
        # 如果不对本区块做出任何编辑, 则生成默认配置固件. 
        # 
        # 以下为定制化固件选项和说明:
        #
        #
        # 有些插件/选项是默认开启的, 如果想要关闭, 请参照以下示例进行编写:

        # 以下是一些提前准备好的一些插件选项.
        # 直接取消注释相应代码块即可应用. 不要取消注释代码块上的汉字说明.
        # 如果不需要代码块里的某一项配置, 只需要删除相应行.
        #
        # 如果需要其他插件, 请按照示例自行添加.
        # 注意, 只需添加依赖链顶端的包. 如果你需要插件 A, 同时 A 依赖 B, 即只需要添加 A.

        # 无论你想要对固件进行怎样的定制, 都需要且只需要修改 EOF 回环内的内容.
